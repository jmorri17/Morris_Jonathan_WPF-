//Dog Years

//Dogs age 7 times faster than humans so a dog that is 1 year old in human years is 7 years old in “dog years.”
// Calculate how old Sparky the pit bull is in dog years based on his actual age.

// variables
// x = dogSparky
// y = human

var x =(1);
var y =(7);
//alert(x * y);

//output

console.log ("Sparky is", " " + (x * y));

//Slice of Pie part1

// A bunch of students are having a party and somebody ordered pizza. Create an expression that calculates how much pizza each partygoer will get at the party.
// (Assume all pizzas have the same number of slices and that the person dividing the pizza is really precise,so this can be a decimal, like 3.52 slices, etc.)

//variables
var slices = 3.52;
var people = 10;
var pizzas = 6;
var perPerson = slices * pizzas / people;
var b = perPerson + "Per Person";

//output
console.log(b);

//Slice of Pie part 2

//At the pizza party Sparky, the host’s dog is excited, because he gets the leftover pizza after the slices have been divided up evenly among the guests.
// Assume guests get whole slices, how many whole slices will Sparky feast on?
